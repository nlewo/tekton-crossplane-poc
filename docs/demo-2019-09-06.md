# Intro

- What is Tetkon
  "The Tekton Pipelines project provides Kubernetes-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines."
- From where it comes from
  From the [KNative project](https://knative.dev/)
- Community/license
  Open Weekly meeting, 1000 commit, 90 contributors, 15 with more than 19 commits

- Status
  Still WIP

# The Tekton model

- Task
  - inputs
  - outputs
  - steps
- TaskRun

- Pipeline
  - resources
  - tasks
- PipelineRun

- Pipeline resource
  - git resource
  - image resource
  - ...

# How we deployed it

https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md#adding-the-tekton-pipelines

# The demo usecase

- We want to build a Go application which uses a Mysql database
- The Go application exposes a REST API endpoint
  We forked https://github.com/johan-lejdung/go-microservice-api-guide

- The Go application is deployed as a Kubernetes pod
- And an Amazon managed Mysql database (RDS) is used

# Starting the demo...

1. Run a task
2. Run a pipeline

## Create a pipeline resource

Show the [resource](../tekton/app-git.yaml) 

## Create a task and run it

Show the [task](../common/tekton/build-docker-image-from-git-source.yaml) 

A task consists of 
- inputs (resources / params)
- outputs
- steps

To run the task, apply:
- ../common/tekton/build-docker-image-from-git-source.yaml
- ../tekton/app-git.yaml
- ../tekton/rest-api-image.yaml
- ../tests/build-docker-image-from-git-source-run.yaml

## Create a pipeline and run it

Show the [pipeline](../tekton/pipeline.yaml) 

To run the pipeline, apply:
- ../tekton/poc-git.yaml
- ../tekton/pipeline.yaml
- ../tekton/pipeline-run.yaml


# Misc

- Triggers
  - How to trigger a PipelineRun
- [Tekton Catalog](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog)
- PipelineRun History


# Conclusion & Next steps

- Stability
- Easy to understand, to debug
- Based on Kubernetes: runner for free, metadata storage for free, HA, ecosystem

- Use it for a project CI: build, test, distribute
- Try the tooling on top of Tekton
- Explore caching and reproducibility


# Discussions
- Where to run pipelines?
